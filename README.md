# customer_banking - Module 3 Challenge
The purpose of this assignment is to create elements of a simple customer banking system.  It will set up a simple savings account and a certificate of deposit based on user inputs of starting balance, interest rate, and term (in months).
The system will accept user inputs, validate then, calculate interest, define data structures for each account, and then print interest earned and current balance (including interest earned) for each account.

The code adheres to the specifications, and adds validations to ensure that negative values are not given for balances, rates, or months.

## Source
All code is based on templates provided, and is my work.

## Where is the code?
The four modules are all in the top level folder of my "customer_banking" repo.
